# SOLT

SOLT (Stochastic Optimization Learning Tool) is a learning tool about gradient descent and stochastic optimization, and in particular the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm.

## Website

The SOLT website contains information about the gradient descent and SPSA algorithms together with pseudo-code of the algorithms: https://nanned.github.io/SOLT/.

## Jupyter Notebooks

SOLT contains several Jupyter Notebooks with implementations of the algorithms to experiment with the algorithms by yourself. You can directly use the notebooks in a Binder environment by clicking on the Binder button below:

You can also download the Jupyter Notebooks [from the repository](https://github.com/NanneD/SOLT/tree/main/notebooks) and run these in your own environment.
